## Checklist

- [ ] Given that this code will have to be maintained by someone else in
      the future that it's not me, my code is clean, concise and it has
      been tested.
- [ ] There is an issue tracking this feature and I've linked to it in my
      PR, where a discussion may have been held, because I'd rather not
      add surprise features without discussing whether they fit or not
      in the project scope before.
- [ ] The files conforming this PR have been formatted with prettier
      so that they follow the code styleguide.
